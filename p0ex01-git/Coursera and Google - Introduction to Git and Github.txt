Coursera and Google: Introduction to Git and Github

Git is a CVS (control version system).
Github is a database of programmers and their codes (like a social network).

DIFFING FILES:
[user@pc] ~$ diff helloWorld.py helloFriend.py
	Returns only the lines that are different between the two files.
		> Means the line was added to the file
		< Means the line was removed from the file
		5c5, 6 means the line 5 changed to line 5 and 6
		11a13, 15 means lines 13 thru 15 was added
[user@pc] ~$ diff -u helloWorld.py helloFriend.py
	Returns the difference in a more friendly format
		+ means a line was added
		- means a line was removed
Other diffs:
wdiff: Returns the different words highlighted
meld:
KDiff3
vimdiff
Another usefull way to use diff
[user@pc] ~$ diff -u old_file.c new_file.c > change.diff
	It will generate a file containing all the changes between both
It can show any external work by peers, and also gives us an easy patch to use with the PATCH command
[user@pc] ~$ patch file.c < file.diff
